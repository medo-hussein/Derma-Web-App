# üß¥ Derma - Skin Disease Diagnosis Web App

**Derma** is a Django-based web application that uses deep learning to assist in the preliminary diagnosis of skin diseases. Users can upload images of affected skin, and the system will analyze the image using an AI model to predict the likely condition.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This app is for educational and demo purposes only. It is **not** intended for professional medical diagnosis.

## üì∏ How It Works

1. The user uploads a photo of the affected skin area through the web interface.
2. The backend processes the image and passes it to a trained deep learning model.
3. The model predicts the possible skin disease based on the image.
4. The predicted result is displayed on the website.
